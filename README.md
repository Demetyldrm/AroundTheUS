# Project 3: Around The U.S.
 
  
**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. I used responsive design patterns to adjust the elements for desktop and tablet sizes. Flexbox, Grid ,Media Queries and BEM principals were used to create this website.
